A hundred years ago people all over the world lived very differently from they live now.
Let’s look at some ways in which daily life has changes enormously since then.
Washing:
A hundred years ago, washing clothes was much more difficult and time-consuming because people did not have washing machines.
In most parts of the UK, for example, there was no running water and people washed their clothes in huge tubs of boiling water.
They often collected this water from public tap in the village and then heated it on a wood fire in the kitchen.
To wash all the family’s clothes, they used about sixty buckets of water.
Keeping clean was not such a priority as it is now, and most people had a bath only once or twice a month, also using the tub in the kitchen.

Keeping cool:
Keeping cool was a priority, however – especially for people living in hot countries.
Nowadays, we have air conditioning to keep our houses cool but then, no modern air conditioning existed.
In some places, like Spain and Turkey, people lived in houses, which were partly caves: large holes cut in the rock in the side of mountain.
The air in these cave-houses was always cool and pleasant.
Other houses often had high ceilings and large windows.
And houses in the Middle East sometimes had wind towers which helped to keep the air moving in the house.
It was also common in many places to hang wet washing around the house to cool it down.

Entertainment:
The most popular entertainment in the home nowadays involves TVs and computers.
In Japan for example, young people spend an average of two and half hours watching TV or playing computer games every day. 
This is a dramatic change from a hundred years ago.
Then , Japanese young people often spent time doing origami (a special kind of art with paper) or practicing calligraphy (a special kind of traditional handwriting).
It was also traditional for the whole family to get together every evening to talk and have tea.
Sometimes these sessions included the children doing performances of music or drama for the other family members to enjoy.

A hundred years ago people all over the world lived very differently from they live now.
Let’s look at some ways in which daily life has changes enormously since then.
Washing:
A hundred years ago, washing clothes was much more difficult and time-consuming because people did not have washing machines.
In most parts of the UK, for example, there was no running water and people washed their clothes in huge tubs of boiling water.
They often collected this water from public tap in the village and then heated it on a wood fire in the kitchen.
To wash all the family’s clothes, they used about sixty buckets of water.
Keeping clean was not such a priority as it is now, and most people had a bath only once or twice a month, also using the tub in the kitchen.

Keeping cool:
Keeping cool was a priority, however – especially for people living in hot countries.
Nowadays, we have air conditioning to keep our houses cool but then, no modern air conditioning existed.
In some places, like Spain and Turkey, people lived in houses, which were partly caves: large holes cut in the rock in the side of mountain.
The air in these cave-houses was always cool and pleasant.
Other houses often had high ceilings and large windows.
And houses in the Middle East sometimes had wind towers which helped to keep the air moving in the house.
It was also common in many places to hang wet washing around the house to cool it down.

Entertainment:
The most popular entertainment in the home nowadays involves TVs and computers.
In Japan for example, young people spend an average of two and half hours watching TV or playing computer games every day. 
This is a dramatic change from a hundred years ago.
Then , Japanese young people often spent time doing origami (a special kind of art with paper) or practicing calligraphy (a special kind of traditional handwriting).
It was also traditional for the whole family to get together every evening to talk and have tea.
Sometimes these sessions included the children doing performances of music or drama for the other family members to enjoy.
