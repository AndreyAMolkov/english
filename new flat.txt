I’m moving out of my parents’ houses soon.
I’ve found a lovely flat to rent and I’m really excited.
It’s in a nice area and the street is really quiet.
But there is a shop just down the road, and a lively cafe, which is great.
The flat is attractive –it looks quite small from the outside, but it feels spacious inside. 
The best room is kitchen – it’s mostly white and very modern. Just my style.
The living room is nice too.
It’s large, comfortable room and the moment, it’s got old-fashioned furniture in it, but I think my furniture will look really good in there.
Also, there’s a door to the garden, which is lovely.
 And the garden is small and quite private … mostly sunny, but with a vice shady area for sitting.
There’s a small bathroom and two bedrooms- one’s quite dark, but the other is really light and sunny.
I’m attaching some photos of the flat.
Of course, it will look different when I move my furniture in, but what do you think?
Do you like it?
