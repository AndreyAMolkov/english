Best Magazine has done some research about some of the best things in life ….
 And might be surprised about the results. First of all, jobs. Our researches showed that the best job you can have is being a firefighter. A job as a firefighter gives plenty of job satisfaction. You are working in a team, you are doing physical work and you are responsible for other people’s health and safety.
Secondly, hobbies. Working with other people is also important when it comes to hobbies, and our research showed that the best hobby is belonging to a choir. Singing in a choir is also creative and it is very satisfying to take part in a public performance.
Thirdly, sport and exercise. Our research revealed that the best all round exercise is swimming and it provides exercise for all the major muscle groups in the body. It is also suitable for people suffering from injuries. People of all ages can also benefit from owning a pet, and dogs came lop of the best bet category. Ownings a dog can reduce stress, blood pressure and the risk of heart disease. The research showed that dog owners were generally happier, more sociable and less likely to visit the doctor.
Finally, if you are keen on keen of keeping healthy, you‘ll be interested in the fact that the best fruit you can eat are blackcurrants. They are really lusty and they contain high levels of vitamin C. They are also full of anti-oxidants, which help in fighting diseases like heart disease and cancer.

So if you are a fighter, who belongs to a choir, goes swimming, owns a dog and eat plenty of blackcurrants, you probably be very happy. But it might also depend on how old you are. Our research also looked at when people said they were the happiest. However, the results were unclear. The best age is  either 17 – people at this age have finally got the freedom they always wanted as a child. Or the best age could be 74 – people are free of the responsibilities of adulthood, and ready to enjoy themselves without feeling worried about what other people think of them.

Our research also looked at when people said they were the happiest. However, the results were unclear. The best age is  either 17 – people at this age have finally got the freedom they always wanted as a child. Or the best age could be 74 – people are free of the responsibilities of adulthood, and ready to enjoy themselves without feeling worried about what other people think of them.
