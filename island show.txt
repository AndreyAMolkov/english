Imagine an Island is  a new radio show, starting this week. Interviewer, Jamie Plummer, ask his guests to imagine they are going to live on a deserted tropical island for long time – maybe forever, if nobody rescues them. There is nothing and nobody on the island – apart from plants and animals. The quests have nothing with them – apart from the few things they are allowed to take. On the show, they talk about how they would feel living on this island and what they would take. Jamie’s first quest is film star Anna Lovaday. Find out what she imagines.
