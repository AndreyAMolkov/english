Are you bored with your home town .... and thinking of moving somewhere more interesting?
Here are a few suggestions of some of the most interesting - and extreme - places in the world where you could go.

1.
Fancy a warm climate? The hottest town in the world which is permanently Inhabited is Wyndham in western Australia. 
All year round, the temperature stays between 31-39 degrees and this coastal town is close to thousands of miles of unspoilt countryside: mostly desert and hills.
There is also spectacular scenery, including the Five Rivers Lookout, where five rivers flow into the sea.

2.
What about somewhere a bit colder? The village of Oymyakon in Russia is the coldest place where people live, with temperatures regularly around -40 degrees.
It is between two mountain ranges so the cold air does move and the ground is always frozen. 
Schools close when the temperature drops to -52 degrees and locals say that breathing gets difficult at about -60 degrees.

3. Do you ever complain about the rain ..? 
Then think about the people in Lioro near the west coast of Colambia. 
They have a lot of rain - more than 1.300 centimetres a year. 
The people make their money by cutting down trees in the forest nearby, where you can be sure that it will be rain every day of year.

4. From one extreme to another ..
Aswan in Egypt is the driest place on Earth where people live, with an average 0,05 centimetres rainfall a year.
The last time it rained in Aswan was on 13th May 2006, and the time before that was in 1994.
Lucklly, Aswan is an valley on the banks of river Nile, which provides water for drinking and farming, as well as tranportation.

5. Do you want to get away from everything?
Tristan da Cunha is the most remote place in the world, somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
These islands consist of mostly mountains and the nearest neighbours are 2,816 kilometres away.
In South Africa .
There no airport, but there are many beaches along the beauthiful coast where you can swim.

Are you bored with your home town .... and thinking of moving somewhere more interesting?
Here are a few suggestions of some of the most interesting - and extreme - places in the world where you could go.

1.
Fancy a warm climate? The hottest town in the world which is permanently Inhabited is Wyndham in western Australia. 
All year round, the temperature stays between 31-39 degrees and this coastal town is close to thousands of miles of unspoilt countryside: mostly desert and hills.
There is also spectacular scenery, including the Five Rivers Lookout, where five rivers flow into the sea.

2.
What about somewhere a bit colder? The village of Oymyakon in Russia is the coldest place where people live, with temperatures regularly around -40 degrees.
It is between two mountain ranges so the cold air does move and the ground is always frozen. 
Schools close when the temperature drops to -52 degrees and locals say that breathing gets difficult at about -60 degrees.

3. Do you ever complain about the rain ..? 
Then think about the people in Lioro near the west coast of Colambia. 
They have a lot of rain - more than 1.300 centimetres a year. 
The people make their money by cutting down trees in the forest nearby, where you can be sure that it will be rain every day of year.

Are you bored with your home town .... and thinking of moving somewhere more interesting?
Here are a few suggestions of some of the most interesting - and extreme - places in the world where you could go.

1.
Fancy a warm climate? The hottest town in the world which is permanently Inhabited is Wyndham in western Australia. 
All year round, the temperature stays between 31-39 degrees and this coastal town is close to thousands of miles of unspoilt countryside: mostly desert and hills.
There is also spectacular scenery, including the Five Rivers Lookout, where five rivers flow into the sea.

2.
What about somewhere a bit colder? The village of Oymyakon in Russia is the coldest place where people live, with temperatures regularly around -40 degrees.
It is between two mountain ranges so the cold air does move and the ground is always frozen. 
Schools close when the temperature drops to -52 degrees and locals say that breathing gets difficult at about -60 degrees.

3. Do you ever complain about the rain ..? 
Then think about the people in Lioro near the west coast of Colambia. 
They have a lot of rain - more than 1.300 centimetres a year. 
The people make their money by cutting down trees in the forest nearby, where you can be sure that it will be rain every day of year.

4. From one extreme to another ..
Aswan in Egypt is the driest place on Earth where people live, with an average 0,05 centimetres rainfall a year.
The last time it rained in Aswan was on 13th May 2006, and the time before that was in 1994.
Lucklly, Aswan is an valley on the banks of river Nile, which provides water for drinking and farming, as well as tranportation.

5. Do you want to get away from everything?
Tristan da Cunha is the most remote place in the world, somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
These islands consist of mostly mountains and the nearest neighbours are 2,816 kilometres away.
In South Africa .
There no airport, but there are many beaches along the beauthiful coast where you can swim.
