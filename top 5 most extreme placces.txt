Are you bored with your home town .... and thinking of moving somewhere more interesting?
Here are a few suggestions of some of the most interesting - and extreme - places in the world where you could go.

1.
Fancy a warm climate? The hottest town in the world which is permanently Inhabited is Wyndham in western Australia. 
All year round, the temperature stays between 31-39 degrees and this coastal town is close to thousands of miles of unspoilt countryside: mostly desert and hills.
There is also spectacular scenery, including the Five Rivers Lookout, where five rivers flow into the sea.

2.
What about somewhere a bit colder? The village of Oymyakon in Russia is the coldest place where people live, with temperatures regularly around -40 degrees.
It is between two mountain ranges so the cold air does move and the ground is always frozen. 
Schools close when the temperature drops to -52 degrees and locals say that breathing gets difficult at about -60 degrees.
