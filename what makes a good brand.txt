Nowadays, clothes aren’t just clothes, and drinks aren’t just drinks: they are brands. But what – apart from a good product – makes a good brand great?
A good name is the First thing. Ideally, it should be memorable and it should be  easy to say in any language (think Zara, or Coca Cola). When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started their computer company in the 1970s they considered names like Matrix Electronics. But Jobs once worked on an apple 
Farm in California and that gave him the idea for Apple Computers.
Spelling isn’t important either. Google was originally “Googol” which refers to a number 1 followed by 100 zeros- indicating the amount of knowledge it would make available on the internet.
