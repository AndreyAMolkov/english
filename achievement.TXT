In 2013, I set myself the goal of learning English in order to freely read and listen to books.
When I was a schoolboy, I studied German, so learning English was not an easy task.
Modern phones allow you to voice any text.
I broke the texts into short parts and set them to listen constantly.
First of all, I learned the alphabet, studied simple texts and listened to them.
I chose the time to study when I was driving.
After 2 years, I went to business English courses, and in the same way I learned new words from textbooks.
After that, I was able to improve my vocabulary with the help of business books. I read and listened to my first book for 3 months.
Six months ago, I started watching films with English subtitles, also using the phone.
And I was able to partially configure the computer to translate speech into text, it helped me a lot in meetings.
A week ago, I was able to fully watch films without subtitles, and on Friday I realized that I fully understand what is being discussed at meetings.
I have not yet fully achieved my goal, but I see that I am going on the right path.
