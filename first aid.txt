Firs Aid is the help you give someone when they are ill or injured before doctors arrive. 
People who give first aid are ordinary people who are near the person in need.
Sometimes they are trained to give first aid.
But even if they are not trained, someone who gives first aid could save your life.
There are two basic rules of first aid.
Firstly, you need to get the person out of danger.
This could mean trying to stop bleeding, or moving the person away from the middle of a busy road.
Secondly, you need to get help quickly.
In Britain, you need to phone 999 or 112 to get an ambulance.
